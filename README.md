# aoc-2021
My solutions for AOC this year. Don't expect great code :D  
If you want to run a solution without having to build it, you can use:
```bash
# If you don't specify the day, it'll default to day 1
./gradlew runSolution -Pday=<day>
```
Inputs should go in the inputs dir, following the naming scheme:
"day-&lt;day&gt;.txt", and the day should be 2 characters
(e.g. day one is day-01.txt and day 23 is day-23.txt)
