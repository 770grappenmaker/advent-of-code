# advent-of-code ðŸŽ„
This repo contains all of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

## Running
Run the current day (during advent) using
```shell
./gradlew solution
```
Run a specific solution using (year defaults to last Advent of Code, unless the current date is in November or December)
```shell
./gradlew solution --args "<day> [<year>]"
```
You can also specify an alternative input file (relative to the inputs/year directory) with
```shell
./gradlew solution --args "<day> <year> [<input>]
```
